Select is used to select and show data

syntax to display specific data:-
			SELECT colName FROM tableName;
syntax to display all data:-
			SELECT * FROM tableName;
if there are many users with different ages and some of them are with same ages we want to display
only unique ages then then we use DISTINCT with name of variable
//code
DROP TABLE post;
CREATE TABLE post(id int,content varchar(50),userid int);
INSERT INTO post VALUES(101,"Hello World",3),(102,"Bye Bye",2),(103,"Hello Delta",1),(102,"Hello Alpha",0);
SELECT * FROM post;
SELECT id,content FROM post;
SELECT DISTINCT id FROM post;
