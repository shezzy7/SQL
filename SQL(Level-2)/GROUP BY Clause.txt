GROUP BY Clause:-
		It groups rows that have the same values in summary rows.
		It collects data from multiple records and groups the rbesult by one or more column.
		Syntax -> SELECT col1,col2 FROM tabName GROUP  BY colName
		Usually we use group with some aggregasion function.
		Example:-
		
		CREATE TABLE user(id int ,name varchar(30),age int,email varchar(50),followers int,following int);
		INSERT INTO user VALUES(1,"shahzad",20,"shezzy@gmail.com",150,10),(2,"goodo",17,"Zaini@gmail.com",160,5),(3,"Chooti goodo",15,"simleyGirl@gamil.com",250,16),(4,"Deeja",20,"writer@gmail.com",175,18);
		SELECT COUNT(id) FROM user GROUP BY age;
		--the above querry means first make groups of user according to ages and then count no of ids in each group and display them
