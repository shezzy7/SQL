HAVING Clause :-
		It is similiar to WHERE Clause.It applies some conditions on rows
		But it is used when we want to apply any condition after grouping 
		Syntax:-	SELECT co1,col2 FROM tabName GROUP BY colNAme HAVING condition;
		Keep in mind WHERE is for the column and HAVING is for the row
		Grouping is necessary for HAVING

		Example:-
			
			CREATE TABLE user(id int ,name varchar(30),age int,email varchar(50),followers int,following int);
			INSERT INTO user VALUES(1,"Shahzad",21,"shezzy@gmail.com",150,10),(2,"goodo",19,"Zaini@gmail.com",160,5),(3,"Chooti goodo",19,"simleyGirl@gamil.com",250,15);
			--let we want to group table by age and want to display name and followers of those groups whose follower count is greater then 200 then
			SELECT name,followers FROM user GROUP BY age HAVING COUNT(followers)>200;
